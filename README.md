# KoboCloud
A set of scripts to synchronize a kobo reader with popular cloud services. At the moment Owncloud and Dropbox are supported

## Installation
Run the script `make-KoboRoot`. This will create a KoboRoot.tgz archive. Copy said archive in the `.kobo` directory of your reader (it is a hidden directory, so you might want to enable the visualization of hidden files) and restart your Kobo.

## Configuration
After restarting, plug your kobo back into the computer. Navigate to the `.kobo` directory. A new kobocloud directory should have appeared. Inside, edit the file kobocloudrc to add the links to the cloud services (one per line).
Notice: No subdirectories are supported at the moment, so be sure that your books are all in the same directories that you are sharing. **Important:** make sure that there are no spaces before or after the link on the line.

### Nextcloud (Owncloud)
To add a nextcloud (owncloud) link, open your nextcloud website in a browser and select the folder that you want to share. Click on "Share" and select "Share with link". Copy the link into the kobocloudrc file.
Please note that you need a recent Nextcloud version. Owncloud is at the moment not tested, but should also work.

### Dropbox
To add a Dropbox link, open your dropbox in a browser. Select the folder that you want to share and click "Share" and "Send link". Copy the link that appears into the kobocloudrc file.

### pCloud
Files added into a subfolder of the *public* folder of pCloud are also supported. Add the public link to the containing folder (starting with https://filedn.com/) to the kobocloudrc file.

### Google Drive
Google Drive is supported. Use the "link sharing" option on a Google Drive folder and select the option "anyone with the link can view." Copy-paste the link in the kobocloudrc file. *Note:* Folders with many files might not work.

### Restart
Restart your Kobo after making changes to kobocloudrc to make them effective.

## Usage
The new files will be downloaded when the kobo connects to the Internet for a sync.

## Uninstallation
To properly uninstall KoboCloud, edit the kobocloudrc file so that it contains the word `UNINSTALL` in a single line (all capital, no spaces before or after). Restart your Kobo. The next time the Kobo is connected to the Internet, the program will delete itself.
The directory .kobo/kobocloud will not be deleted: after connecting the ereader to a computer, you should move the files from the Library subfolder in order not to lose your content, and delete the whole kobocloud directory manually.

## Troubleshooting
KoboCloud keeps a log of each session in the `.kobo/kobocloud/get.log` file. If something goes wrong, useful information can be found there. Please send a copy of this file with every bug report.

## Known issues
* No subdirectories are supported
* Some versions of Kobo make the same book appear twice in the library. This is because it scans the internal directory where the files are saved as well as the "official" folders. To solve this problem find the `Kobo eReader.conf`file inside your `.kobo` folder and add the following:
```
[FeatureSettings]
ExcludeSyncFolders=\\.kobo/kobocloud/Library.*
```
